# Search Plugin

This plugin integrates a full-text search for your website. It is based on flexsearch.

Just activate the plugin and it will add a search field to your website (depending on your theme). The plugin does not require any third-party-software like Google Search or Algolia. Instead it includes the JavaScript search library [flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) and generate a full-text search index on the fly.
